  A cyborg programmed to lack and disregard sentience, Major Motoko Kusanagi
muses on what kind of answers about her identity she is yet to discover. Amid a
futuristic, post-war backdrop, the Japanese anime classic <i>Ghost in the Shell (1995)</i>
critiques the concept of identity through the protagonist’s inner trife and highlights the
nuanced nondualism between man and machine, and the uncertainty and confusion
echoed throughout the story evokes a dominantly melancholic mood throughout the
film that beautifully captures the essence of Japanese aesthetics.

<i>Ghost in the Shell</i> does a profound job of communicating <i>yugen</i> through scenes
without dialogue and just instrumentals, such as when Motoko is looking down from a
skyscraper at the city, looking into the glossy windows and observing the people from
afar. <i>Yugen</i>  describes the feeling of coming upon a scene that elicits a profound sense
of awe because of its natural and artistic beauty. What is special about <i>yugen</i> is its
non-dualistic aspect of perceptual and interior depth: the scene that presents itself has
physical depth to it, and the emotions that result involve reflection within the
individual. There is a darkness and unknown to <i>yugen</i>, and embraces the obscure and
mysterious quality of the universe.

Motoko often dives in the expansive seawater in the outskirts of the city, an
activity that is described as “strange” for a cyborg. When she submerges her body
underwater, we see that the environment is serene, devoid of life, and nothing but a
vibrant blue that transitions into a murky black. <i>Yugen</i> is present in the physical depth
of the water, exhibited by the pitch black darkness into which she sinks into. This
profound combination of physical and emotional depth is a quintessential example of
<i>yugen</i>. She rises to the surface, and is mirrored by her reflection. The emotional depth
emerges as her contemplations. In the scene, she says that being in the sea brings her
“fear, anxiety, isolation, and darkness” and sometimes hope. When she floats to the
water, she feels like she’s becoming someone else.

A computer program that somehow gained sentience over the years, Project
2501 wishes to be more human, but knows that it is limited in becoming human because
of its inability to reproduce. Motoko and Project 2501 (the Puppet Master) are by far
the most complex characters that arise from <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>, and are key examples of
non-duality in the climax of the film. When Project 2501 and Motoko are lying side by
side and telepathically communicating, Project 2501 declares that it and Motoko are
one and the same, for they share the same qualities of being non-human but
self-aware. As separate but interwoven entities, their merging – a surprising moment in
the film – is a physical manifestation of nonduality. Project 2501 is also a key example
of reflexivity: despite achieving self-awareness, it knows that it is but a self-aware
program that has limitations from the complete human experience (reproduction and
death). When Motoko “dies”, she catches a glimpse of an angel, which indicates her
transcendence.
