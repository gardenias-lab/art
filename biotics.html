<h3> Excerpt of “The Biotics of Fashion”</h3>
<h4> by Arden Wang</h4>
<h5> The following excerpt makes reference to Haruki Murakami’s “Tony Takitani”, written as a final paper for
my English class Texts and Contexts: The Fashion System.</h5>

<p class="indented">
    The vitality of the fashion industry remains dependent on dominating the female
    body to bring commodities to life. The female body is an appendage to fashion, for it itself
    is commodified. A breath of life is whisked into an article of clothing when a woman wears
    it, initiating a transaction with the consumer’s gaze. In Haruki Murakami’s “Tony Takitani”,
    the characterization of Tony Takitani’s wife is a commentary on commodity fetishism.
    Takitani’s wife is described as a woman who heavily indulges in purchasing clothing, to the
    point of having more than she could ever wear. She has trouble curbing her obsession with
    shopping, and dies in a car accident with clothing being the last thing she was thinking
    about. The exchange of breath represents the entwined relationship that the female body
    has with clothing. Clothing takes the breath of its consumer for two purposes: to fuel the
    fantasy it promises and to suffocate its wearer. The first kind ensures that the consumer is
    ensnared in the fantasy, and keeps the fantasy alive by finding new customers that are
    seemingly impervious to the power of clothing.
</p>
<p class="indented">
    Takitani decides to hire a female assistant after his wife passes away, for the sole
    purpose of having the woman wear his deceased wife’s dresses. Takitani’s assistant is the
    “impervious woman” who is yet to become influenced by the entrapment of clothing that
    Takitani’s wife fatally suffered. Her initial inspection of the dresses causes a breath-taking
    reaction: “Each dress was obviously expensive and of high quality. The taste, too, was
    flawless. The sight was almost blinding. The woman could hardly catch her breath. Her
    heart started pounding. It felt like sexual arousal, she realized”. Upon trying on the
    dresses, the woman begins to cry, as she experiences the magic of the dresses by running
    her fingertips over the material and breathing its fragrance. The dress came alive when it
    was worn. Takitani’s termination of the assistant’s job may have cut the assistant’s fantasy
    short, but it leaves a lasting impression on her and she wears the dresses that she kept.
</p>
<p class="indented">
    The second kind of breath-taking surfaces after the initial stage of awe, when the
    fantasy begins to serve its sinister intention of suffocation. This form of breath-taking
    functions by debilitating the body and also the mind. Takitani’s wife attempts to curb her
    spending habits and chooses to spend a week at home. She has a harrowing experience of
    feeling as though “she were walking on the surface of a planet with little air...”. Takitani
    himself experiences a feeling of suffocation as the clothes in the closet consume air
    greedily. Takitani’s wife winds up consumed by the idea of clothing, both physically and
    mentally.
</p>
<p class="indented">
    At the same time clothing takes away women’s breath, their breath is returned to
    them in the form of a commodity. Commodities pose as a short-term solution, an antidote
    that doesn’t cure the body. Clothing without a wearer is often described as devoid of life
    (although the instance of Takitani experiencing breathlessness in his wife’s closet may
    suggest otherwise – that the clothes feed on air in the absence of the body.) Takitani calls
    the dresses the “shadows that his wife had left behind”. He says to his assistant: “It's just
    to give me the time to get used to the idea that my wife is gone. If you are nearby wearing
    her clothing, I'm pretty sure, it will finally come home to me that she is dead”. The clothes
    linger as a ghostly presence of her life, in the same way she was once defined by them.
</p>
<p class="indented">
    While clothing dominates the female body, the vitality of the fashion industry
    remains dependent on it to bring commodities to life. As appendages to fashion, the
    female body is commodified when it moves in clothing that is attempting to engage a
    transaction with a viewer. The interdependence of fashion and the female body for survival
    should come as no surprise, but the nature of this relationship is presented based on the
    unsuspecting fantasy, in measures to obscure the damages that take place on the living.
    While fashion aims to integrate clothing and the female body into a singular unit, clothing
    is capable of emerging unscathed because it is not truly alive, whereas the female body
    experiences physical and mental deterioration. Women from both ends of the transaction,
    as salesgirls and as consumers, find themselves corrupted and trapped in the closed
    system of fashion. The women find themselves ceasing to breathe, but find it returned to
    them in the form of what is unsustainable, and give life into what is not truly alive. The
    destruction of the female body goes unseen, for they are misunderstood. The gradual
    descent into madness is treated as pure illness and society is unable to comprehend the
    demise of the women.
